      <h2>Welcome to <a href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a></h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> is a web-application framework
that includes everything needed to create database-backed web applications
according to the Model-View-Control pattern.
</p>
<p>
This pattern splits the view (also called the presentation) into
&quot;dumb&quot; templates that are primarily responsible for inserting
pre-built data in between HTML tags. The model contains the
&quot;smart&quot; domain objects (such as Account, Product, Person, Post)
that holds all the business logic and knows how to persist themselves to a
database. The controller handles the incoming requests (such as Save New
Account, Update Product, Show Post) by manipulating the model and directing
data to the view.
</p>
<p>
In <a href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>, the model is handled by
what&#8216;s called an object-relational mapping layer entitled Active
Record. This layer allows you to present the data from database rows as
objects and embellish these data objects with business logic methods. You
can read more about Active Record in <a
href="vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html">files/vendor/rails/activerecord/README.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
The controller and view are handled by the Action Pack, which handles both
layers by its two parts: Action View and Action Controller. These two
layers are bundled in a single package due to their heavy interdependence.
This is unlike the relationship between the Active Record and Action Pack
that is much more separate. Each of these packages can be used
independently outside of <a href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>. You can
read more about Action Pack in <a
href="vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html">files/vendor/rails/actionpack/README.html</a>.
</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<ol>
<li>At the command prompt, create a new <a
href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> application:

<pre>
    &lt;tt&gt;rails new myapp&lt;/tt&gt; (where &lt;tt&gt;myapp&lt;/tt&gt; is the application name)
</pre>
</li>
<li>Change directory to <tt>myapp</tt> and start the web server:

<pre>
    &lt;tt&gt;cd myapp; rails server&lt;/tt&gt; (run with --help for options)
</pre>
</li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://localhost:3000">localhost:3000</a>/ and you&#8216;ll
see:

<pre>
    &quot;Welcome aboard: You're riding Ruby on Rails!&quot;
</pre>
</li>
<li>Follow the guidelines to start developing your application. You can find

</li>
</ol>
<p>
the following resources handy:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The Getting Started Guide: <a
href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html">guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html</a>

</li>
<li>Ruby on <a href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> Tutorial Book: <a
href="http://www.railstutorial.org">www.railstutorial.org</a>/

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Debugging <a href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a></h2>
<p>
Sometimes your application goes wrong. Fortunately there are a lot of tools
that will help you debug it and get it back on the rails.
</p>
<p>
First area to check is the application log files. Have &quot;tail -f&quot;
commands running on the server.log and development.log. <a
href="../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> will automatically display debugging
and runtime information to these files. Debugging info will also be shown
in the browser on requests from 127.0.0.1.
</p>
<p>
You can also log your own messages directly into the log file from your
code using the Ruby logger class from inside your controllers. Example:
</p>
<pre>
  class WeblogController &lt; ActionController::Base
    def destroy
      @weblog = Weblog.find(params[:id])
      @weblog.destroy
      logger.info(&quot;#{Time.now} Destroyed Weblog ID ##{@weblog.id}!&quot;)
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
The result will be a message in your log file along the lines of:
</p>
<pre>
  Mon Oct 08 14:22:29 +1000 2007 Destroyed Weblog ID #1!
</pre>
<p>
More information on how to use the logger is at <a
href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core">www.ruby-doc.org/core</a>/
</p>
<p>
Also, Ruby documentation can be found at <a
href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">www.ruby-lang.org</a>/. There are several
books available online as well:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Programming Ruby: <a
href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby">www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby</a>/
(Pickaxe)

</li>
<li>Learn to Program: <a
href="http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram">pine.fm/LearnToProgram</a>/ (a
beginners guide)

</li>
</ul>
<p>
These two books will bring you up to speed on the Ruby language and also on
programming in general.
</p>
<h2>Debugger</h2>
<p>
Debugger support is available through the debugger command when you start
your Mongrel or WEBrick server with &#8212;debugger. This means that you
can break out of execution at any point in the code, investigate and change
the model, and then, resume execution! You need to install ruby-debug to
run the server in debugging mode. With gems, use <tt>sudo gem install
ruby-debug</tt>. Example:
</p>
<pre>
  class WeblogController &lt; ActionController::Base
    def index
      @posts = Post.find(:all)
      debugger
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
So the controller will accept the action, run the first line, then present
you with a IRB prompt in the server window. Here you can do things like:
</p>
<pre>
  &gt;&gt; @posts.inspect
  =&gt; &quot;[#&lt;Post:0x14a6be8
          @attributes={&quot;title&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;body&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;id&quot;=&gt;&quot;1&quot;}&gt;,
       #&lt;Post:0x14a6620
          @attributes={&quot;title&quot;=&gt;&quot;Rails&quot;, &quot;body&quot;=&gt;&quot;Only ten..&quot;, &quot;id&quot;=&gt;&quot;2&quot;}&gt;]&quot;
  &gt;&gt; @posts.first.title = &quot;hello from a debugger&quot;
  =&gt; &quot;hello from a debugger&quot;
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;and even better, you can examine how your runtime objects actually
work:
</p>
<pre>
  &gt;&gt; f = @posts.first
  =&gt; #&lt;Post:0x13630c4 @attributes={&quot;title&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;body&quot;=&gt;nil, &quot;id&quot;=&gt;&quot;1&quot;}&gt;
  &gt;&gt; f.
  Display all 152 possibilities? (y or n)
</pre>
<p>
Finally, when you&#8216;re ready to resume execution, you can enter
&quot;cont&quot;.
</p>
<h2>Console</h2>
<p>
The console is a Ruby shell, which allows you to interact with your
application&#8216;s domain model. Here you&#8216;ll have all parts of the
application configured, just like it is when the application is running.
You can inspect domain models, change values, and save to the database.
Starting the script without arguments will launch it in the development
environment.
</p>
<p>
To start the console, run <tt>rails console</tt> from the application
directory.
</p>
<p>
Options:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Passing the <tt>-s, &#8212;sandbox</tt> argument will rollback any
modifications made to the database.

</li>
<li>Passing an environment name as an argument will load the corresponding
environment. Example: <tt>rails console production</tt>.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
To reload your controllers and models after launching the console run
<tt>reload!</tt>
</p>

href="../http:/www.rubycentral.com/pickaxe/irb.html">http://www.rubycentral.com/pickaxe/irb.html</a>
</p>
<h2>dbconsole</h2>
<p>
You can go to the command line of your database directly through <tt>rails
dbconsole</tt>. You would be connected to the database with the credentials
defined in database.yml. Starting the script without arguments will connect
you to the development database. Passing an argument will connect you to a
different database, like <tt>rails dbconsole production</tt>. Currently
works for MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite 3.

</pre>
<p>
app
</p>
<pre>
  Holds all the code that's specific to this particular application.
</pre>
<p>
app/controllers
</p>
<pre>
  Holds controllers that should be named like weblogs_controller.rb for
  automated URL mapping. All controllers should descend from
  ApplicationController which itself descends from ActionController::Base.
</pre>
<p>
app/models
</p>
<pre>
  Holds models that should be named like post.rb. Models descend from
  ActiveRecord::Base by default.
</pre>
<p>
app/views
</p>
<pre>
  Holds the template files for the view that should be named like
  weblogs/index.html.erb for the WeblogsController#index action. All views use
  eRuby syntax by default.
</pre>
<p>
app/views/layouts
</p>
<pre>
  Holds the template files for layouts to be used with views. This models the
  common header/footer method of wrapping views. In your views, define a layout
  using the &lt;tt&gt;layout :default&lt;/tt&gt; and create a file named default.html.erb.
  Inside default.html.erb, call &lt;% yield %&gt; to render the view using this
  layout.
</pre>
<p>
app/helpers
</p>
<pre>
  Holds view helpers that should be named like weblogs_helper.rb. These are
  generated for you automatically when using generators for controllers.
  Helpers can be used to wrap functionality for your views into methods.
</pre>
<p>
config
</p>
<pre>
  Configuration files for the Rails environment, the routing map, the database,
  and other dependencies.
</pre>
<p>
db
</p>
<pre>
  Contains the database schema in schema.rb. db/migrate contains all the
  sequence of Migrations for your schema.
</pre>
<p>
doc
</p>
<pre>
  This directory is where your application documentation will be stored when
  generated using &lt;tt&gt;rake doc:app&lt;/tt&gt;
</pre>
<p>
lib
</p>
<pre>
  Application specific libraries. Basically, any kind of custom code that
  doesn't belong under controllers, models, or helpers. This directory is in
  the load path.
</pre>
<p>
public
</p>
<pre>
  The directory available for the web server. Contains subdirectories for
  images, stylesheets, and javascripts. Also contains the dispatchers and the
  default HTML files. This should be set as the DOCUMENT_ROOT of your web
  server.
</pre>
<p>
script
</p>
<pre>
  Helper scripts for automation and generation.
</pre>
<p>
test
</p>
<pre>
  Unit and functional tests along with fixtures. When using the rails generate
  command, template test files will be generated for you and placed in this
  directory.
</pre>
<p>
vendor
</p>
<pre>
  External libraries that the application depends on. Also includes the plugins
  subdirectory. If the app has frozen rails, those gems also go here, under
  vendor/rails/. This directory is in the load path.
